    <p>A doctype is a document type declaration (DTD), which informs the browser about the document to be expected on the webpage. The HTML doctype is not a tag or element of the HTML; rather, the HTML doctype tells the browser about the specifications like the version of the HTML or the standards.</p>
    <p><mark>Note :</mark> The HTML doctype is a null element, i.e. it is self-closing and mustn't contain any content within itself.
    In HTML 5, the declaration is simple:  <mark>< ! DOCTYPE html ></mark>
    </p>
