        An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML text. You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.

            <li>Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.</li>
            <li>If you have used an open tag <tag>, then you must use a close tag </tag> (except some tags)</li> 
            <li> HTML Tags are always written in lowercase letters.</li>
